# Flow Control

  ## If, Else, and Elif Statements
  1. An if statement can be used to conditionally execute code, depending on whether or not the if statement's condition is True or False
  2. An elif statement can follow an if statement. Its block executes if its condition is True and all the previous conditions have been false.
  3. An else statement comes at the end. Its block is executed if all of the previous conditions have been False.
  4. The values 0, 0.0, and the empty string are considered Falsey values. When used in conditions they are considered False. You can always see for yourself which values are Truthy or Falsey by passing them to the bool() funciton.
